## Occupations

### Just by employment numbers

51-4121 Welders, Cutters, Solderers, and Brazers
51-4031 Cutting, Punching, and Press Machine Setters ...
51-4041 Machinists
49-9071 Maintenance and Repair Workers, General
51-2031 Engine and Other Machine Assemblers

### Other

Theoretically we can extract

- employment raise
- mean wages
- wage raise

from [https://www.bls.gov]

But I don't think it's expected in the scope of this project
