### Reasoning

#### Durable Goods Manufacturing

- Third in GDP at minimum

##### 3311

- Second highest employee per establishments count
- Tenth highest pay per person

Why Rüggeberg-Tools:

Forging metals

##### 3330A1

- Fourth highest employee count
- Low payed workers

Why Rüggeberg-Tools:

Building machines

##### 3361

- Highest employee per establishments count
- Second highest pay per person

Why Rüggeberg-Tools:

A little "maybe" as they put the parts together, but they could make use of
the tools

##### 3363

- Fifth highest in employee count
- Sixth highest in employee per establishments count
- Low payed workers

Why Rüggeberg-Tools:

Construct car parts out of metal

#### Constructions

- Eight highest GDP

##### 2381

- Second highest employee count

Why Rüggeberg-Tools:

Tools should also translate their usage into wood-/stoneworking, which is
needed in foundation and frame building

## Occupations

### Just by employment numbers

51-4121 Welders, Cutters, Solderers, and Brazers
51-4031 Cutting, Punching, and Press Machine Setters ...
51-4041 Machinists
49-9071 Maintenance and Repair Workers, General
51-2031 Engine and Other Machine Assemblers

### Other

Theoretically we can extract

- employment raise
- mean wages
- wage raise

from [https://www.bls.gov]

But I don't think it's expected in the scope of this project
